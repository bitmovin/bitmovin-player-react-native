  /**
   * Enable the default behavior of displaying media information
   * on the lock screen, in notifications, and within the control center.
   *
   * Default is `true`.
   *
   * For a detailed list of the supported features in the **default behavior**,

   * ## Limitations
   * ---
   * - Android: If an app creates multiple player instances, the player shown in media controls is the latest one created having media controls enabled.
   * - At the moment, the current media information is disabled during casting.
   *
   * ## Known Issues
   * ---
   * **iOS**:
   * - There is unexpected behavior when using the IMA SDK. The Google IMA SDK adds its own commands
   *   for play/pause as soon as the ad starts loading (not when it starts playing). Within this window
   *   (approximately around 10 seconds), it is possible that both the ad and the main content are playing
   *   at the same time when a user interacts with the media control feature.
   *
   * ## Default Supported Features
