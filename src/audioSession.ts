 * An audio session category defines a set of audio behaviors.

 * Note the `playback` category is required in order to properly enable picture in picture support.
 *
 * - `ambient`: The category for an app in which sound playback is nonprimary â€” that is, your app also works with the sound turned off.
 * - `multiRoute`: The category for routing distinct streams of audio data to different output devices at the same time.
 * - `playAndRecord`: The category for recording (input) and playback (output) of audio, such as for a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) app.
 * - `playback`: The category for playing recorded music or other sounds that are central to the successful use of your app.
 * - `record`: The category for recording audio while also silencing playback audio.
 * - `soloAmbient`: The default audio session category.
