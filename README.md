## Feature Support

Features of the native mobile Player SDKs are progressively being implemented in this React Native library. The table below summarizes the current state of the main Player SDK features.

| Feature                          | State                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

| Offline Playback                 | :x: Not available                         |

## Installation

Since Bitmovin's native SDKs are distributed through custom [Cocoapods](https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs) and [Maven](https://artifacts.bitmovin.com/ui/native/public-releases) repositories, the installation cannot be managed by React Native's Autolink and requires some extra steps. Please refer to the installation instructions for each platform below. For more information on integrating the native SDKs, refer to the [Getting Started guides](https://bitmovin.com/docs/getting-started).

### Add package dependency

This library is available as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitmovin-player-react-native) and may be added as a dependency to your project using any node-based package manager, e.g.

> npm

```sh
npm install bitmovin-player-react-native --save
```

> yarn

```sh
yarn add bitmovin-player-react-native
```

### Setup iOS Player SDK

If you ran `pod install` after installing the node package and received an error similar to the one below, it is because Bitmovin's custom cocoapods repository has not been added to the `Podfile` and the [`iOS Player SDK`](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-ios-samples) could not be resolved:

```
[!] Unable to find a specification for `BitmovinPlayer (= 3.xx.x)` depended upon by `RNBitmovinPlayer`

You have either:
 * out-of-date source repos which you can update with `pod repo update` or with `pod install --repo-update`.
 * mistyped the name or version.
 * not added the source repo that hosts the Podspec to your Podfile.
```

To fix above error, open your `ios/Podfile` and set up Bitmovin's pods source url:

```ruby
require_relative '../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react_native_pods'
require_relative '../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios/native_modules'

# Bitmovin pods source url
source 'https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs.git'

# iOS version should be 12 or greater.
# If you are running RN 0.69 you should be fine already.
platform :ios, '12.4'
install! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false

target 'MyApp' do
  config = use_native_modules!

  # Rest of Podfile...
```

Now run `pod install` again (try with `--repo-update` if the error persists) - the error should now be resolved.

### Setup Android Player SDK

The Android setup also needs an extra step in order to correctly resolve the [Android Player SDK](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-android-samples) native dependency.

Just make sure to add Bitmovin's artifacts repository to the `allprojects.repositories` section of your `android/build.gradle`:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url("$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android") }
        maven { url("$rootDir/../node_modules/jsc-android/dist") }
        mavenCentral {
            content {
                excludeGroup "com.facebook.react"
            }
        }
        google()
        maven { url 'https://www.jitpack.io' }
        // Add Bitmovin's artifacts repository url
        maven { url 'https://artifacts.bitmovin.com/artifactory/public-releases' }
    }
}
```

## Getting Started

The following is the simplest working component one can create using this library:

```typescript
import React, { useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import { View, Platform, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import {
  usePlayer,
  SourceType,
  PlayerView,
} from 'bitmovin-player-react-native';

export default function PlayerSample() {
  // The `usePlayer` hook creates or references a certain native `Player`
  // instance from within any component.
  const player = usePlayer({
    // The only required parameter is the license key but it can be omitted from code upon correct
    // Info.plist/AndroidManifest.xml configuration.
    //
    // Head to `Setting up a license key` for more information.
    licenseKey: '<ENTER-YOUR-LICENSE-KEY>',
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    // Load a streamable video source during component's initialization.
    player.load({
      // Select url and type dependeding on the running platform.
      url:
        Platform.OS === 'ios'
          ? // HLS for iOS
            'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/m3u8s/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.m3u8'
          : // Dash for Android
            'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/mpds/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.mpd',
      type: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? SourceType.HLS : SourceType.DASH,
      // Optionally set a title that will appear at player's top-left corner.
      title: 'Art of Motion',
      // Optionally load a poster image over the player.
      poster:
        'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/poster.jpg',
      // Optionally set whether poster image will persist over player.
      // Useful for audio-only streams. Default to false.
      isPosterPersistent: false,
    });
  }, [player]);

  // onReady is called when the player has downloaded initial
  // video and audio and is ready to start playback.
  const onReady = useCallback(
    (event) => {
      // Start playback
      player.play();
      // Print event timestamp
      console.log(event.timestamp);
    },
    [player]
  );

  // Make sure to pass the `player` prop in `PlayerView`.
  return (
    <View style={styles.flex1}>
      <PlayerView style={styles.flex1} player={player} onReady={onReady} />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  flex1: {
    flex: 1,
  },
});
```

If you're interested in a complete running example, head to [`example/`](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/tree/main/example).

### Setting up a license key

First of all, create a license key on the [Dashboard](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard) and then make sure to associate your iOS app bundle id with it (see more [here](https://bitmovin.com/docs/player/getting-started/ios#step-3-configure-your-player-license)).

Then your license key can be either set from code or by configuring `Info.plist` and `AndroidManifest.xml`.

#### Through code

```typescript
// Simply pass the `licenseKey` property to `PlayerConfig` when instantiating a player.

// With hooks
import { usePlayer } from 'bitmovin-player-react-native';
const player = usePlayer({
  licenseKey: '<ENTER-YOUR-LICENSE-KEY>',
});

// Without hooks
import { Player } from 'bitmovin-player-react-native';
const player = new Player({
  // Make sure to use React.createRef if instantiating inside a component.
  licenseKey: '<ENTER-YOUR-LICENSE-KEY>',
});
```

#### Through `Info.plist`

Add the following lines to the `<dict>` section of your `ios/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>BitmovinPlayerLicenseKey</key>
<string>ENTER-YOUR-LICENSE-KEY</string>
```

#### Through `AndroidManifest.xml`

Add the following line to the `<application>` section of your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<meta-data android:name="BITMOVIN_PLAYER_LICENSE_KEY" android:value="ENTER-YOUR-LICENSE-KEY" />
```

### Setting up the playback configuration

If needed, the default player behavior can be configured through the `playbackConfig` key when initialized.

```typescript
// Simply pass the `playbackConfig` property to `PlayerConfig` when instantiating a player.

// With hooks
import { usePlayer } from 'bitmovin-player-react-native';
const player = usePlayer({
  playbackConfig: {
    // Specifies whether the playback starts immediately after loading a source or not. Default is false.
    isAutoplayEnabled: true,
    // Specifies if playback starts muted. Default is false.
    isMuted: true,
    // Specifies if time shift for live streams should be enabled. Default is true.
    isTimeShiftEnabled: true,
    // Whether background playback is enabled or not. Default is false.
    // Only available for iOS.
    isBackgroundPlaybackEnabled: true,
    // Enable the Picture in Picture mode option on the player controls.
    //
    // Note iOS requires the audio session category of your app to be set to `playback` otherwise
    // PiP mode won't work.
    //
    // Check out `Enabling Picture in Picture mode` section of README for more information
    // on how to properly configure your app to support PiP.
    isPictureInPictureEnabled: true,
  },
});

// Without hooks
import { Player } from 'bitmovin-player-react-native';
const player = new Player({
  // Make sure to use React.createRef if instantiating inside a component.
  playbackConfig: {
    isAutoplayEnabled: true,
    isMuted: true,
    isTimeShiftEnabled: true,
    isBackgroundPlaybackEnabled: true,
    isPictureInPictureEnabled: true,
  },
});
```

### Accessing native `Player` instances

When you instantiate a player with `usePlayer` or `new Player()` from javascript, you're actually either creating a new `Player` instance in the native side (see [SDKs docs](https://bitmovin.com/docs/player/sdks) for more info) or referencing an existing one.

So it means that a player with the same `nativeId` in two different parts of the code is referencing the same in-memory instance internally.

**Example**

Both components in the example below are referencing the same native `Player` indexed as `my-player`. And even though each `<PlayerView />` creates a different `View` internally, the `Player` instance (which is a separate thing) remains the same. It just gets attached to a different view.

```typescript
// Using `usePlayer`
export const CompA = () => {
  // Same `player` as in `CompB`.
  const player = usePlayer({
    nativeId: 'my-player',
  });
  return <PlayerView player={player} />;
};

// Using `new Player()`
export const CompB = () => {
  // Same `player` as in `CompA`.
  const player = useRef(
    new Player({
      nativeId: 'my-player',
    })
  );
  return <PlayerView player={player.current} />;
};
```

### Listening to events

Both player and source events can be registered from `PlayerView`, but not all of them. For a complete list of the events currently available, checkout [`EventProps`](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/blob/main/src/components/PlayerView/events.ts#L29) and [`events.ts`](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/blob/main/src/events.ts).

To register an event callback, just pass its name prefixed with `on` as a `PlayerView` prop:

```typescript
return (
  <PlayerView
    onReady={onReady}
    onMuted={onMuted}
    onPaused={onPaused}
    onPlayerActive={onPlayerActive}
    onSourceLoaded={onSourceLoaded}
    onPlayerError={onPlayerError}
    onSourceError={onSourceError}
    onPlaybackFinished={onPlaybackFinished}
    {...}
  />
);
```

### Enabling DRM protection

> ⚠️ **Beta Version**: For now, only `FairPlay` is supported on iOS and
> only `Widevine` is supported on Android. More DRM systems will be added in the future.

Simple streaming of protected assets can be enabled with just a little configuration on `SourceConfig.drmConfig`:

```typescript
import { Platform } from 'react-native';
import { SourceConfig, SourceType } from 'bitmovin-player-react-native';

// Source configuration for protected assets.
const drmSource: SourceConfig = {
  // Protected stream URL.
  url:
    Platform.OS === 'ios'
      ? 'https://fps.ezdrm.com/demo/video/ezdrm.m3u8' // iOS stream url
      : 'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/art-of-motion_drm/mpds/11331.mpd', // Android stream url
  // Stream type.
  type: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? SourceType.HLS : SourceType.DASH,
  // DRM setup.
  // Each key in this object maps to a different DRM system config (`widevine` or `fairplay`).
  drmConfig: {
    // Widevine is the default and only DRM system supported on Android for now.
    widevine: {
      licenseUrl: 'https://cwip-shaka-proxy.appspot.com/no_auth',
    },
    // FairPlay is the default and only DRM system supported on iOS for now.
    fairplay: {
      licenseUrl:
        'https://fps.ezdrm.com/api/licenses/09cc0377-6dd4-40cb-b09d-b582236e70fe',
      certificateUrl: 'https://fps.ezdrm.com/demo/video/eleisure.cer',
      prepareMessage: (message, assetId) => {
        return message;
      },
    },
  },
};
```

#### Prepare hooks

In the native SDKs, some DRM properties like `message` and `license` can have their value transformed before use in order
to enable some more complex use cases: such as extracting the `license` from a `JSON`, for example.

In order to handle such transformations, it's possible to hook methods onto `SourceConfig.drmConfig` to proxy DRM values
and potentially alter them:

```typescript
import { Platform } from 'react-native';
import { SourceConfig, SourceType } from 'bitmovin-player-react-native';

// Source configuration for protected assets.
const drmSource: SourceConfig = {
  // Protected stream URL.
  url:
    Platform.OS === 'ios'
      ? 'https://fps.ezdrm.com/demo/video/ezdrm.m3u8' // iOS stream url
      : 'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/art-of-motion_drm/mpds/11331.mpd', // Android stream url
  // Stream type.
  type: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? SourceType.HLS : SourceType.DASH,
  // DRM setup.
  drmConfig: {
    // Widevine is the default and only DRM system supported on Android for now.
    widevine: {
      licenseUrl: 'https://cwip-shaka-proxy.appspot.com/no_auth',
      // Data is passed as a base64 string and expects to return a base64 string.
      prepareLicense: (license: string) => {
        // Do something with the `license` value...
        // And return processed data as base64 string.
        return license; // base64 string
      },
    },
    // FairPlay is the default and only DRM system supported on iOS for now.
    fairplay: {
      licenseUrl:
        'https://fps.ezdrm.com/api/licenses/09cc0377-6dd4-40cb-b09d-b582236e70fe',
      certificateUrl: 'https://fps.ezdrm.com/demo/video/eleisure.cer',
      // Data is passed as a base64 string and expects to return a base64 string.
      prepareLicense: (license: string) => {
        // Do something with the `license` value...
        // And return processed data as base64 string.
        return license; // base64 string
      },
      // Data is passed as a base64 string and expects to return a base64 string.
      prepareMessage: (message: string, assetId: string) => {
        // Do something with the `assetId` and `message` values...
        // And return processed data as base64 string.
        return message; // base64 string
      },
    },
  },
};
```

The [`FairplayConfig`](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/blob/development/src/drm/fairplayConfig.ts) interface provides a bunch of hooks that can be used to fetch and transform different DRM related data. Check out the [docs]([https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/blob/development/src/drm/fairplayConfig.ts](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/blob/development/src/drm/fairplayConfig.ts)) for a complete list and detailed information on them.

Also, don't forget to check out the [example](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/tree/development/example) app for a complete iOS/Android [DRM example](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/blob/development/example/src/screens/BasicDrmPlayback.tsx).

### Adding external subtitle tracks

Usually, subtitle tracks are provided in the manifest of your content (see [Enconding Manifests API](https://bitmovin.com/docs/encoding/api-reference/sections/manifests) for more information). And if they are provided this way, the player already recognizes them and show them in the subtitles selection menu without any further configuration.

Otherwise, it's also possible to add external tracks via the subtitle API:

```typescript
import { Platform } from 'react-native';
import {
  SourceConfig,
  SourceType,
  SubtitleFormat,
} from 'bitmovin-player-react-native';

// Source config with an external subtitle track.
const config: SourceConfig = {
  url:
    Platform.OS === 'ios'
      ? 'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8'
      : 'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/sintel.mpd',
  type: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? SourceType.HLS : SourceType.DASH,
  poster: 'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/poster.png',
  // External subtitle tracks list to be added to this source.
  subtitleTracks: [
    // You can select 'Custom English' in the subtitles menu.
    {
      // The URL of the subtitle file. Required.
      url: 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/subtitles/subtitles_en.vtt',
      // External file format.
      // Supports `.vtt`, `.ttml` and `.cea` extensions.
      //
      // This option can be left empty since the player automatically recognizes the format
      // from the provided url most of the time.
      format: SubtitleFormat.VTT,
      // Label for this track shown under the selection menu. Required.
      label: 'Custom English',
      // The IETF BCP 47 language tag associated with this track. Required.
      language: 'en',
      // The unique identifier used for this track.
      // The default value for this options is a randomly generated UUID.
      identifier: 'sub1',
      // This track is considered the default if set to `true`.
      // The default value for this option is `false`.
      isDefault: false,
      // If set to `true` it means that the player should automatically select and switch this
      // subtitle according to the selected audio language. Forced subtitles do not appear in
      // `Player.getAvailableSubtitles`.
      //
      // The default value for this option is `false`.
      isForced: false,
    },
    // You may add even more tracks to the list...
  ],
};
```

The supported `PlayerView` events for subtitles are:

- `onSubtitleAdded`
- `onSubtitleRemoved`
- `onSubtitleChanged`

You might check out a complete subtitle example in the [`example/`](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/tree/development/example) app.

### Adding external thumbnail track

Thumbnail seeking is a must have for any video longer than a few minutes. It increases usability and the general QoE [(Quality of Experience)](https://bitmovin.com/ultra-high-definition-quality-experience-mpeg-dash-part-1/) dramatically.

Setting up is simple with the Bitmovin Player. Thumbnails are loaded into the timeline as a track. All you need to do is to tell the player the location of the thumbnail file:

```typescript
import { Platform } from 'react-native';
import {
  SourceConfig,
  SourceType,
  SubtitleFormat,
} from 'bitmovin-player-react-native';

// Source config with an external subtitle track.
const config: SourceConfig = {
  url:
    Platform.OS === 'ios'
      ? 'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8'
      : 'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/sintel.mpd',
  type: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? SourceType.HLS : SourceType.DASH,
  poster: 'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/poster.png',
  // External thumbnail track url to be added to this source.
  thumbnailTrack:
    'https://cdn.bitmovin.com/content/assets/art-of-motion-dash-hls-progressive/thumbnails/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.vtt',
};
```

What’s required for a video player with thumbnails

Adaptive Streaming relies on encoding your video into several groups of files (streams) at various resolutions, while thumbnails also need to be generated in the encoding process. The encoder creates a set of thumbnail images and combines them into a single image file (“Sprite”). For more information on encoding your videos, have a look at our [Cloud Encoding Service](https://bitmovin.com/encoding/).

### Enabling Picture in Picture mode

In order to make use of the Picture in Picture functionalities provided by the player, it's first necessary to configure your native application to properly support PiP.

The steps required for each platform are described below:

#### Android

**Declare Picture in Picture support on AndroidManifest.xml**

Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and set `android:supportsPictureInPicture` to `true`
on your main activity's manifest. Also, specify that your activity handles layout configuration changes
so that your activity doesn't relaunch when layout changes occur during PiP mode transitions:

```xml
<activity android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:supportsPictureInPicture="true"
    android:configChanges=
        "screenSize|smallestScreenSize|screenLayout|orientation"
    ...
```

#### iOS

**Set background modes capability**

Make sure to add the `UIBackgroundModes` key to the `dict` section of your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

This step can also be performed from [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-background-execution-modes).

**Configure audio session on app startup**

Configure your app's `AudioSession` category to `playback` during the main component's initialization:

```typescript
import { AudioSession } from 'bitmovin-player-react-native';

// App's root component
const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Set your app's `AudioSession` category to `playback` on initialization.
    // Please, note even though this step is required for iOS it won't take any effect on Android.
    AudioSession.setCategory('playback').catch((error) => {
      // Handle any native error that might occur during this process.
      handleError(error);
    });
  });
  // ...
  return /* ... */;
};
```

This step is required in order to properly enable background playback on iOS. Without it, the Picture in Picture option appears on the player UI but has no effect when used.

You can read more about it on [Apple's docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosession/category/1616509-playback).

#### Showing the Picture in Picture UI option

Now that your native application is properly configured to support PiP changes, the player instance
in your JS code can be configured to show the Picture in Picture option in the player UI.

Simply add `isPictureInPictureEnabled: true` on your player's `playbackConfig` option:

```typescript
const player = usePlayer({
  playbackConfig: {
    isPictureInPictureEnabled: true,
  },
});
```

#### Supported Picture in Picture events

The supported Picture in Picture events on `PlayerView` are:

- `onPictureInPictureEnter`
- `onPictureInPictureExit`

**iOS only**

- `onPictureInPictureEntered`
- `onPictureInPictureExited`

**Android only**

- `onPictureInPictureAvailabilityChanged`

Check [`events.ts`](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/blob/development/src/components/PlayerView/events.ts) for more information about them.

### Customize HTML UI (Android and iOS only)

The Bitmovin Player SDKs use the open source [Bitmovin Player Web UI](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-ui) on all platforms, except tvOS.
The UI is customizable in multiple ways.

#### Custom implementation

Since the Bitmovin Player Web UI is open source, it can be forked and modified to tailor to any application's needs.
See [Cusomizing the UI](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-ui#customizing-the-ui) section for details.

In case a custom implementation of the Player UI is desired, configure the hosted JS and CSS files via the `StyleConfig` as shown in the following example:

```ts
const player = usePlayer({
  styleConfig: {
    playerUiCss: 'CUSTOM_UI_CSS_URL',
    playerUiJs: 'CUSTOM_UI_JS_URL',
  },
});
```

#### Custom CSS

Customization of the default built-in Bitmovin Player UI is possible via providing custom styling CSS by only configuring `playerUiCss` as shown in the following example:

```ts
const player = usePlayer({
  styleConfig: {
    playerUiCss: 'CUSTOM_UI_CSS_URL',
  },
});
```

#### Supplemental CSS

In case the usage of the default Bitmovin Player UI is sufficient with minor additional styling, it can be achieved via providing the URL to the additional CSS stylesheet via `supplementalPlayerUiCss`.

```ts
const player = usePlayer({
  styleConfig: {
    supplementalPlayerUiCss: 'SUPPLEMENTAL_UI_CSS_URL',
  },
});
```

### Setting up fullscreen handling

In order to enable the player to support fullscreen and show the fullscreen button when using the Bitmovin Player Web UI, a `FullscreenHandler` needs to be implemented.
Its responsibility is to update the UI when transitioning between fullscreen and non-fullscreen states.
The player view itself does not update it's presentation as the meaning of fullscreen is determined by the application integrating our library.

Here are the basics of enabling fullscreen support:

```typescript
// Define a handler to take care of fullscreen transitions
class SampleFullscreenHandler implements FullscreenHandler {
  isFullscreenActive: boolean = true;
  onFullscreen: (fullscreenMode: boolean) => void;

  constructor(
    isFullscreenActive: boolean,
    onFullscreen: (fullscreenMode: boolean) => void
  ) {
    this.isFullscreenActive = isFullscreenActive;
    this.onFullscreen = onFullscreen;
  }

  enterFullscreen(): void {
    // Update UI state for fullscreen mode
    this.onFullscreen(true);
    this.isFullscreenActive = true;
    console.log('enter fullscreen');
  }

  exitFullscreen(): void {
    // Update UI state for non-fullscreen mode
    this.onFullscreen(false);
    this.isFullscreenActive = false;
    console.log('exit fullscreen');
  }
}

export default function BasicFullscreenHandling() {
  // Set up player and other components

  // Create SampleFullscreenHandler instance and enable it to update state
  const [fullscreenMode, setFullscreenMode] = useState(false);
  const fullscreenHandler = new SampleFullscreenHandler(
    fullscreenMode,
    setFullscreenMode
  );

  return (
    <View>
      <PlayerView
        player={player}
        style={fullscreenMode ? styles.playerFullscreen : styles.player}
        fullscreenHandler={fullscreenHandler}
        onFullscreenEnter={onFullscreenEnter}
        onFullscreenExit={onFullscreenExit}
        onFullscreenEnabled={onFullscreenEnabled}
        onFullscreenDisabled={onFullscreenDisabled}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

// Define your styles
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  player: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: 'black',
  },
  playerFullscreen: {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 0,
    right: 0,
    bottom: 0,
    left: 0,
    backgroundColor: 'black',
  },
});
```

Check [`BasicFullscreenHandling.tsx`](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/blob/development/example/src/screens/BasicFullscreenHandling.tsx) for a full example implementation.

#### Supported fullscreen related events

The supported fullscreen events on `PlayerView` are:

- `onFullscreenEnter`
- `onFullscreenExit`
- `onFullscreenEnabled`
- `onFullscreenDisabled`

Check [`events.ts`](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/blob/development/src/components/PlayerView/events.ts) for more information about them.

### Setting up ads

The Bitmovin Player SDKs are capable of displaying Ads out of the box and there are two ways they can be
configured with the player. One option is to use static configuration in the player config object,
and the other is to schedule them dynamically using `Player.scheduleAd`.

#### Static ads configuration

The easiest way to configure Ads is by adding the `advertisingConfig` property to the player configuration object.
All that needs to be provided is a URL pointing to a target Ad tag along with the type of the tag.

```typescript
const player = usePlayer({
  licenseKey: '<PLAYER_LICENSE_KEY>',
  advertisingConfig: {
    // Each object in `schedule` represents an `AdItem`.
    schedule: [
      // An `AdItem` represents a time slot within the streamed content dedicated to ads playback.
      {
        // Each item specifies a list of sources with a type and URL to the ad manifest in the ads
        // server. All but the first source act as fallback if the first one fails to load.
        // The start and end of an ad break are signaled via `AdBreakStartedEvent` and `AdBreakFinishedEvent`.
        sources: [
          {
            type: AdSourceType.IMA,
            tag: 'https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/124319096/external/single_ad_samples&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&cust_params=deployment%3Ddevsite%26sample_ct%3Dskippablelinear&correlator=',
          },
          // Fallback sources...
        ],
        // Each item also specifies the position where it should appear during playback.
        // The possible position values are documented below.
        // The default value is `pre`.
        position: '20%',
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

The possible `AdItem` position values are:

- `"pre"`: pre-roll ad (for VoD and Live streaming; appears before playback starts)
- `"post"`: post-roll ad (for VoD streaming only; appears after playback finishes)
- Fractional seconds: `"10"`, `"12.5"` (mid-roll ad, for VoD and Live streaming)
- Percentage of the entire video duration: `"25%"`, `"50%"` (mid-roll ad, for VoD streaming only)
- Timecode `hh:mm:ss.mmm`: `"00:10:30.000"`, `"01:00:00.000"` (mid-roll ad, for VoD streaming only)

#### Dynamic ads scheduling

To gain more flexibility, it is also possible to schedule an `AdItem` dynamically in code using the
`Player` instance. To do this, you need to call the `scheduleAd` method.

```typescript
// The object passed to `scheduleAd` must be an `AdItem`.
player.scheduleAd({
  // Ad source with fallbacks.
  sources: [
    {
      tag: '<AD-URL>',
      type: AdSourceType.IMA,
    },
  ],
});
```

An `AdScheduledEvent` event is dispatched when the ad is successfully scheduled via `scheduleAd`.

Also, during playback, it's also possible to check whether an ad is being played with `player.isAd()`
and skip the ad being currently played with `player.skipAd()` (see `AdSkippedEvent`).

#### Supported ads events

The supported `PlayerView` events for ads are:

- `onAdBreakFinished`
- `onAdBreakStarted`
- `onAdClicked`
- `onAdError`
- `onAdFinished`
- `onAdManifestLoad`
- `onAdManifestLoaded`
- `onAdQuartile`
- `onAdScheduled`
- `onAdSkipped`
- `onAdStarted`

You can check out a complete ads example in the [`example/`](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/tree/development/example) app.

### Setting up analytics

Each `Player` instance has an associated analytics collector that can be configured to send analytics information about it. By default,
the associated collector is disabled unless an `analyticsConfig` option is specified. So in order to get analytics up and running, add the following configuration options to your `PlayerConfig`:

```typescript
const player = usePlayer({
  analyticsConfig: {
    // Bitmovin analytics key from the Analytics Dashboard
    key: '<ANALYTICS-KEY>', // `key` is the only required parameter.
    // Bitmovin player license key
    playerKey: '<BITMOVIN-PLAYER-KEY>',
    // Asset CDN provider. Check out `CdnProvider` on `src/analytics/config.ts` for more options.
    cdnProvider: CdnProvider.AKAMAI,
    // User-defined user ID.
    customUserId: 'Custom user ID',
    // Whether the user ID should be randomly generated or not. Default value is false.
    randomizeUserId: false,
    // Experiment name that'll appear at the Analytics Dashboard.
    experimentName: 'Experiment name',
    // Video ID on your server
    videoId: 'MyVideoId',
    // Video title
    title: 'Art of Motion',
    // Whether this is a live stream video. Default is false.
    isLive: false,
    // Whether collector should also collect statistics about ads
    // Can be changed to `true` in case `advertisingConfig` is also present.
    // Default is false.
    ads: false,
    // Navigation breadcrumb.
    // The path taken by the user inside your application.
    path: '/examples/basic_analytics',
    // List of custom data fields to be registered at the Analytics Dashboard.
    // Useful to customize collection with your own data along with the SDK.
    customData1: 'Custom data field 1',
    customData2: 'Custom data field 2',
    customData3: 'Custom data field 3',
    customData4: 'Custom data field 4',
    customData5: 'Custom data field 5',
    // Usage of customData properties are supported up to 30 fields
    customData30: 'Custom data field 30',
  },
});
```

And that's it. Now you should start receiving analytics information about your `player` instance on the [Analytics Dashboard](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard/analytics).

Optionally, you can also access the configured `analyticsCollector` object in order to get some information (like `userId`) or
update your custom data during runtime:

```typescript
// Get the current user id.
const userId = await player.analyticsCollector?.getUserId();

// Get the current custom data config.
const customData = await player.analyticsCollector?.getCustomData();

// Update the current custom data config.
player.analyticsCollector?.setCustomDataOnce({
  customData2: 'Updated custom data field 2',
  customData4: 'Updated custom data field 4',
});
```

You can check out a complete analytics example in the [`example/`](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-player-react-native/tree/development/example) app.
